# Towards Dynamic Algorithm Selection for Numerical Black-Box Optimization: Investigating BBOB as a Use Case
## Repository of used code

The code in this repository was used to load and process the BBOB-algorithms [from their repository](https://coco.gforge.inria.fr/doku.php?id=algorithms-bbob) and process them using the [IOHanalyzer tool](https://github.com/IOHprofiler/IOHanalyzer).

The processed version of the data (rds-file), as well as all figures and tables generated for this paper can be found [here](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/H796FDuN7fUGLpK).
